Date!\" (This also causes the voice that counts down before a track starts to say \"Date!\" instead of \"Go!\", and have a lower quality\/more pixelated style voice.)<\/li>\r\n<li>Introduce lore\/plot within the game.<\/li>\r\n<li>Have a background that doesn't move with the beat of the song (Thorns).<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\r\n<li>Much of Week 6, such as its gameplay with the new art style, track names and sprites were leaked ahead of its intended release.<\/li>\r\n<li>There is a glitch in Week 6 where if the player presses the R key on their keyboard (a key that causes an instant game over) during the cutscenes in Story Mode, the cutscene and its music will freeze while the sounds of <b>Boyfriend's<\/b> skeleton cracking and the mic dropping play. However, the Game Over music will not play afterwards and the game will be locked. Players will be forced to restart the game to play it again.\r\n<ul><li>The cutscene in <b>Thorns<\/b>, while also affected, will still play the sounds created from <b>Senpai<\/b> dying due to it being sound effects.<\/li><\/ul><\/li>\r\n<li>There used to be a bug where if a player presses some keys too quickly near the beginning of the cutscenes, it will freeze while the music is still playing. This was fixed in version 0.2.7.1.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Thorns<\/b> previously did not use the pixel-art-style death animation and the chiptune version of the game over music, unlike with the other two tracks of Week 6. The regular death animation and game over music plays instead. This was fixed in version 0.2.7.1.<\/li>\r\n<li>All character icons for this week lack \"danger\" versions. This extends not only to the antagonists, but <b>Boyfriend<\/b> as well.<\/li>\r\n<li>Week 6 is currently the holder of the shortest time between released weeks. <b>Week 5<\/b> was released on the 20th of January while Week 6 was released on the 2nd of February, meaning there was only a 13 day gap between releases.<\/li>\r\n<li><b>Girlfriend<\/b> will not briefly cry when the player breaks a +10 combo streak. This is due to a lack of an animation for it.<\/li>\r\n<li>In the game files, the background girls in <b>Senpai (Song)<\/b> and <b>Roses<\/b> are labeled \"bgFreaks.png.\"<\/li>\r\n<li>The school in the background was originally meant to have a much more <b>fancier design<\/b> compared to the one in the final game.<\/li>\r\n<li>Week 6 is the second week to have multiple antagonists, the first being <b>Week 5<\/b>.<\/li><\/ul><\/div>",
    "slide_title_9" : "9. Rules!",
    "slide_content_9" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><p>Before you get started, here's a list of our rules. It is important that you read and understand them before continuing on. We highly encourage users to edit, even if you aren't experienced. If you make a mistake, the staff or other users can help to rectify any problems. We all share a common goal of improving the wiki and making it an accurate source for all Friday Night Funkin' fans and newcomers.\r\n<\/p><p>1. Vandalism is strictly prohibited and perpetrators will be banned on sight. Admins reserve the right to fully ban your IP address if you continuously vandalize. It is very likely that you will be banned indefinitely from the community <b>without warning<\/b> if you are caught vandalizing multiple pages.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul><li>Please note that if you haven't made an account, your IP will be shown if you edit.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>2. This wiki is meant for the documentation of <b>in-game content<\/b> only. Mods, fan-made content and other creations <b>not made by the actual creators of the game<\/b> are not allowed to be added to this wiki in their own article no matter how well-made they are. They will be removed on sight without exception.\r\n<\/p><p>3. Refrain from adding headcanons (personal interpretations of canon), major information without sources and double check before adding any information \"confirmed\" by <b>Ninjamuffin99.<\/b>\r\n<\/p><p>4. Do not create blank pages with titles that are irrelevant to the game or those that are similar to already-existing pages. These will be deleted and users will be warned. If a user continues to make more or brings back any that were previously deleted, they will be banned.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul><li>Do not move existing pages to change their titles either. This will almost certainly be reverted. If you have a problem with an article title, speak with an admin first.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>5. Refrain from trolling on the wiki. You aren't as funny as you think you are.\r\n<\/p><p>6. Refrain from commenting and posting sexual\/explicit jokes or content on the wiki. This includes inappropriate images, videos and sound files to the wiki's galleries. NSFW content is not acceptable and will be removed and the poster will face consequences.<b><\/b>\r\n<\/p><p>7. Do not role-play on the wiki. This isn't the place for that and we encourage you to go look elsewhere. You may be warned and then temporarily banned if you attempt to do so. We also ask that you refrain from ship discussions (character pairings) on the wiki as well due to the likelihood of harassment and fights spurring from such topics. If users are caught in an argument over them, all parties involved could face a temporary ban.\r\n<\/p><p>8. We absolutely <b>do not<\/b> tolerate homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism or any kind of harassment on this wiki for any reason. Even as a \"joke\", that kind of behavior is unacceptable and you could face serious consequences.\r\n<\/p><p>9. The wiki staff will try to resolve disputes to the best of our ability, take suggestions when editing protected pages, ban users that are acting inappropriately, delete irrelevant pages and more. If there is ever an issue within the wiki or the forums, it is best to contact an admin first rather than try to sort the situation yourself.\r\n<\/p><p>10. Do not request for admin rights. Not only is it rude, it makes the existing wiki staff less trusting of your abilities, especially if you have done very little to actually prove yourself as a respectable editor\/contributor of the wiki.\r\n<\/p><p>11. Do not false report comments and posts. In most cases, anything reported that does not break the rules or violates the guidelines in the staff's eyes will not have any actions taken against it. Continuous false reports may result in a warning and any further false reporting could result in a temporary ban.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<ul><li>A self-report (reporting your own posts\/comments) will be seen as a deletion request.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n<p>12. Do not spam. This behavior is annoying and can clutter a discussion or disrupt wiki activity. This also includes making unhelpful edits over and over on an article and then fixing it yourself. Anyone who is caught spamming or continues to spam on the wiki or forums may get banned.\r\n<\/p><p>13. Swearing is generally ok on the wiki and forums. However, be mindful of others as you could face consequences if you use them towards someone in a hurtful manner. Excessive swearing will result in your comments being removed. No matter who you are, the use of derogatory slurs are <b>completely unacceptable<\/b> and will result in serious consequences on top of being removed.\r\n<\/p><p>14. Don't try to work around any of the rules, a.k.a. gaming the system. Bending them, finding a loop hole or manipulating definitions in an attempt to avoid punishment will not be tolerated <b>at all<\/b>. There is no justification for actions deemed offendable by the staff by reading in between the lines or saying that what you are being punished for wasn't explicitly written down. If you are caught engaging in bad behavior, you will face consequences, regardless of whatever elaborate excuses you come up with.\r\n<\/p><p>15. Do not blame someone else as an excuse for any rule breaking done on your account. The staff has absolutely no way of verifying that sort of claim so we must assume you did it. Depending on your past contributions\/wiki activity, the staff might give you a more lenient punishment, but in all cases, it is your responsibility to protect your account from being used by someone else.\r\n<\/p><p>16. Admins can dictate how long a user is banned for. IP bans are usually indefinite to keep vandals away. Appeals are granted with <b>very<\/b> limited exceptions. Do not argue or challenge the admins over your punishment. The staff makes an effort to remain fair in our judgement in all cases, but you could make things worse for yourself if you continue acting immaturely, irrationally or try to escalate the situation, especially if you return after a previous ban.<\/p><\/div>",
