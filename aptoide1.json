Yes, when people think of an alternative to Google Play Store, they switch to Aptoide.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aptoide was launched in the year of 2009 with the idea of users being able to manage their store instead of a unique or centralized store. This store is currently in its 8th version with the versions such as Aptoide for smartphones and tablets, Aptoide TV \u2013 an edition for smart TVs and STBs, Aptoide VR, and Aptoide Kids \u2013 developed for children\u2019s devices. Aptoide is run by an android application that is used to access the stores. This is an open-source application where the communication between the client and servers is carried on with an open protocol based on XML.<\/p><\/div>",

Although you would find those apps or the same premium apps for free across other stores. The same goes for apps that come with a lot of ads and you can get an ad-free version for free from a different store.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On Aptoide, you would find apps uploaded by someone who already has bought the original app or accessed it from elsewhere but not the owner or the company themselves. Unlike Play Store, Aptoide is a free platform and hence, anyone can upload applications to the platform. Aptoide lets you download the apk of the app and install it for further use.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aptoide is user friendly and also lets users\/developers monetize and promote their apps.
