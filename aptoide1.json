Yes, when people think of an alternative to Google Play Store, they switch to Aptoide.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aptoide was launched in the year of 2009 with the idea of users being able to manage their store instead of a unique or centralized store. This store is currently in its 8th version with the versions such as Aptoide for smartphones and tablets, Aptoide TV \u2013 an edition for smart TVs and STBs, Aptoide VR, and Aptoide Kids \u2013 developed for children\u2019s devices. Aptoide is run by an android application that is used to access the stores. This is an open-source application where the communication between the client and servers is carried on with an open protocol based on XML.<\/p><\/div>",

Although you would find those apps or the same premium apps for free across other stores. The same goes for apps that come with a lot of ads and you can get an ad-free version for free from a different store.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On Aptoide, you would find apps uploaded by someone who already has bought the original app or accessed it from elsewhere but not the owner or the company themselves. Unlike Play Store, Aptoide is a free platform and hence, anyone can upload applications to the platform. Aptoide lets you download the apk of the app and install it for further use.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aptoide is user friendly and also lets users\/developers monetize and promote their apps. No doubt you would find many apps on Aptoide and the maximum would be from non-genuine users, you can also check for genuine and malware-free apps (having a verified badge) to avoid any kind of trouble.<\/p><\/div>",

After passing through them, Aptoide's home page will appear (see the screenshot below).<\/p>\r\n<p>The <strong>toolbar<\/strong> is located at the bottom of the screen. With the \"Home\" button near the bottom left corner, one can return to the initial (home) view of this app.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The home view presents some popular applications.&nbsp; You can get to the actual list of apps divided into a number of categories by tapping the APPS button near the top right corner and by scrolling the display. If you tap \"MORE\" instead of scrolling, a list of top apps will be shown to you.<\/p>\r\n<p>The \"Apps\" button at the right end of the toolbar has the apps that you have installed on your phone (once you have done that). It will also indicate for which of those apps there are updates.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Aptoide-home-view.png\" src=\"https:\/\/jolla.zendesk.com\/hc\/article_attachments\/4408789091346\/Aptoide-home-view.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\">&nbsp;<\/p><\/div>",
