His arms and legs are several feet in length and end in large yellow hands and feet. The hands have large Velcro straps on them, and the feet possess four digits including thumbs, though they are fused together and are unable to move individually (with the exception of the thumbs). His torso is stout and disproportionately small in comparison to his long limbs. His head is large and contains two large black, dilated eyes. On his face are oversized, bright red, cartoonish lips.\r\n\r\nHis monster counterpart remains largely the same, with the exception of his eyes being dilated bigger than intended, giving off a deranged and disturbing physique. Behind his lips is a maw of dozens of jagged needle-like teeth. Closer observation of Huggy's mouth shows a secondary set of jaws located by his throat, akin to that of a Moray Eel.  \r\n   <br><br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/static.wikia.nocookie.net\/pplaytime\/images\/2\/26\/HuggyWuggyHD.png\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/350?cb=20211220214227\" width=\"350\"><\/div>",

A feminine counterpart was created a year after Huggy's creation.\r\n\r\nDuring an unknown date in time, In an effort to create the perfect living toy, Playtime Co. conducted numerous unethical and highly illegal experiments, one such example being Huggy Wuggy. Despite being created for the purpose of becoming a child-friendly mascot and being a prototype, Huggy went rampant. During his murderous rampage, Huggy killed many of the scientists and workers of the facility he was kept in. Huggy would go on to remain in the abandoned facility for decades until the eventual return of The Player.\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nHuggy is first seen standing in his statue form by the player in an exhibition hall. When the player's back is turned, Huggy will hold a key on his right arm but remain motionless. After taking the key and turning the power back on in the Innovation Wing, the player returns to the exhibition hall only to find that Huggy has now disappeared.\r\n\r\nHuggy goes on to stalk the player as they make their way through the facility. After the player manages to turn back on the toy-making machines and bypasses a door system using a toy made from the machines, Huggy reveals himself. Following the player into the facility's ventilation system, an intense chase ensues as Huggy attempts to catch and devour the player. After managing to momentarily escape Huggy and landing on a brittle catwalk, the player pulls a crate onto the crumbling structure just as Huggy bursts from the vents, causing it to collapse. Though the player manages to land safely on another catwalk not far below, Huggy strikes the railing and proceeds to fall into the abyss on the facility, slamming into several pipelines and leaving behind dark red blood splatters. \r\n   <br><br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/static.wikia.nocookie.net\/pplaytime\/images\/f\/f9\/Huggie_colored.png\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/350?cb=20211113040401\" width=\"350\"><\/div>",

He is capable of breaking into incredible bursts of speed, using his long arms and legs to propel himself forward. While crawling through the vents after the player, Huggy is able to bend and contort his body to fit into tight spaces. Before the player drops the crate onto Huggy on the catwalk, he can be seen sprinting towards the player on all fours, much like an ape. Due to his sheer height of approximately 11 feet tall, he possesses a size advantage against average humans. During the vent chase, Huggy is able to cut off and keep up with the player by navigating through the ventilation system. \r\n   <br><br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/M5GpqVfNI-0\/maxresdefault.jpg\" width=\"350\"><\/div>",

It is speculated that Playtime Co. made her due to the fact that Huggy skyrocketed in popularity, and so seized the opportunity to create a feminime counterpart to further boost the popularity.\r\n\r\nThis was and still is a common trope in almost every industry to date. Should there be a boy\/girl version, it is expected that an opposing gendered-variant based of the original is created to accommodate the original. Whether this is simply to cater to multiple demographics or enforce heteronormativity (or both), it usually depends on the context. Recently, it has been confirmed that Kissy Missy is Huggy Wuggy's love interest. \r\n<p><\/p>\r\n  <br><br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/static.wikia.nocookie.net\/pplaytime\/images\/f\/fc\/Female_huggie_colored.png\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/350?cb=20211102212410\" width=\"350\"><\/div>",
