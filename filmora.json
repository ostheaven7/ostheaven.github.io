But for communities to work and help ensure that everyone gets the maximum value from their experience, there are a few guidelines for etiquette that, when followed, make the experience much better for everyone else. Here\u2019s a rundown of what you need to keep in mind when you\u2019re a listener, speaker, and moderator.<\/p>\r\n<h3>What Is a Clubhouse App Listener?<\/h3>\r\n<p>When you first join a Clubhouse room, you join as a listener. This means you don\u2019t have access to the microphone, but you can sit quietly and listen to the conversation as it unfolds. It\u2019s customary to sit in the audience until you get a feel for the room and are caught up on the conversation. While you listen in, feel free to tap on any of the speakers or other audience members. You never know who might be in the room with someone you want to connect with later.<\/p>\r\n<p>While you\u2019re in the audience, you can tap on the All Rooms option at the top of the screen to scroll back through the hallway to see what other rooms have started without muting or leaving the conversation.<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/clubhouse-app-all-rooms-option-400@2x.png\" alt=\"ALT\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"324\" height=\"236\"><noscript><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/clubhouse-app-all-rooms-option-400.png\" alt=\"ALT\" \/><\/noscript><\/p>\r\n<p>In fact, one feature that makes Clubhouse stand out from other platforms is the fact that you can minimize the app to check into other apps without losing your place in the chatroom. So you can check your email, follow a speaker over to another platform, or check your DMs over on a different channel without missing a word of the conversation.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you\u2019re ready, tap on the small hand at the bottom-right corner to raise your hand.<\/p>\r\n<h3>What Is a Clubhouse App Speaker?<\/h3>\r\n<p>If you\u2019re brought up to the stage as a speaker, you\u2019ll have the ability to mute and unmute your microphone. As a courtesy, speakers keep their microphones muted while someone else is speaking to minimize background noise.<\/p>\r\n<p>When you\u2019re done speaking, wait for a second or two before you mute your microphone. This helps ensure you don\u2019t accidentally cut yourself off at the end when there\u2019s a lag between your speaking and others\u2019 phones.<\/p>\r\n<p>Every Clubhouse room is run differently depending on the topics being discussed and the way the moderators want to run it. In larger rooms, moderators will often bring a limited number of people up to the stage and ask them to limit their question or insights to a couple of minutes. After that, they\u2019ll do their best to answer the question before moving you back into the audience so they can address the next question.<\/p>\r\n<p>In smaller rooms, you might see an interview happening to which you\u2019re welcome to sit and listen. You may also see the moderators of a small room invite everyone up onto the stage at the same time to share in an open format.<\/p>\r\n<h3>What Is a Clubhouse App Moderator?<\/h3>\r\n<p>There are two ways to become a moderator in a Clubhouse room:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Open a new room.<\/li>\r\n<li>Have a current moderator in the room you\u2019re in promote you from speaker to moderator.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>As a moderator, there are several new options available to you:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Turn on\/off the ability for audience members to raise their hands.<\/li>\r\n<li>Invite people from the audience up to speak.<\/li>\r\n<li>Accept requests from the audience to speak.<\/li>\r\n<li>Promote other speakers to also moderate.<\/li>\r\n<li>Mute other speakers.<\/li>\r\n<li>Send other speakers back to the audience.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Whether you opened the Clubhouse room yourself or were promoted to moderator by another speaker, you help set the tone and conversation within the room. Your moderation will hold a strong influence over the conversation and energy within the room.<\/p>\r\n<p>To help with this, you\u2019ll want to decide on the best way to bring your speakers together before opening a room. Do you want a structured or open format? How will you choose new speakers?<\/p>\r\n<p>As a moderator, you need to be active within the room for as long as the room is open. When the conversation slows down, you\u2019ll want to revive it, invite questions, or encourage others to share in a way that doesn\u2019t pressure anyone else sitting in the room. If the conversation is starting to get chaotic and confusing, bring back some order to make sure you don\u2019t lose anyone in the audience.<\/p>\r\n<p>If the room grows very large, it gets difficult to follow along with who\u2019s speaking. When this happens, take care to introduce people who are speaking or ask speakers to introduce themselves to make it easier for the audience to see who\u2019s speaking.<\/p><\/div>",

People want to see more engagement, value, and transparency but they don\u2019t necessarily want the production and endless waves of content that come with following a brand on social media.<\/p>\r\n<p>There has been a lot of talk on Clubhouse about what will happen once the app leaves private beta and becomes public. Will marketers flood the app? Will eCommerce brands come in and only try to make sales? Will the value and networking possibilities diminish as more people get onto the app? Will the loss of exclusivity make the app lose its splendor?<\/p>\r\n<p>Most of the questions won\u2019t have an answer until Clubhouse App is public. There is also talk of the eventual monetization possibilities of communities there. However, with the loss of exclusivity comes the ability to build communities that are easy to manage and engage with without adding to an already crowded editorial calendar.<\/p>\r\n<p>So it will be exciting to see what happens with the app in the future. And in the meantime, if you\u2019re on Clubhouse, use the exclusivity to your advantage and start making those connections now.<\/p><\/div>",
