In several other video editors, this process is rather time consuming.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I advise you to set your aspect ratio at this stage if you want to have a different setting than this default. For example, you might want to set a 1:1 aspect ratio for a slideshow that you want to share on Instagram. You just need to go to the Ratio\/Crop option from the right menu of the main editing screen.&nbsp;After this, just make sure that all your content and timeline order is in place!<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"attachment_3311\" style=\"width: 2218px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.organizingphotos.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/photo-video-slideshow-filmora-go-8.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"200\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-3311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Set your aspect ratio and select your crop options.
