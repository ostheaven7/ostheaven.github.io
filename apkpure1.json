    "slide_content_0" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><p><strong>APKPure<\/strong> is an open-source service that provides users with direct access to APK (Android application) files. These files can be downloaded on many devices that can run Android, including phones, tablets, e-readers, and specific models of computers, cameras, and smartwatches. You can access the service through its website, https:\/\/APKpure.com\/, or its Android app.<\/p>\r\n<p>ApkPure is known to allow its customers to download \".apk\" and \".xapk\" records without the need for Google PlayStore. There is an extremely real danger related to this site. Sites like these, including Apk-dl and Apkmirror, basically download apps from the Play Store and transfer the \".apk\" document to their sites. These sites are also called external sources. ApkPure also recently released its Android phone app to use to download apps.<\/p>\r\n<p>It may seem convenient to download the apk file from Apkpure. However, <strong>is it safe to download the apk file from Apkpure<\/strong>? Will the file contain a virus? Read along to find out the answer.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/famisafe.wondershare.com\/images\/article\/2020\/11\/apkpure-download-1.jpg\" alt=\"apkpure com\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\"><\/p><\/div>",

    "slide_content_1" : "<div style=\"-moz-user-select: none;-webkit-user-select: none;-ms-user-select: none;-o-user-select: none;user-select: none;\"><p>But why do people choose to download apps from APK websites instead of Google Playstore? Here are some reasons why people choose to download from Apkpure:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/famisafe.wondershare.com\/images\/article\/2020\/11\/apkpure-download-2.jpg\" alt=\"apkpure download\" width=\"350\"><\/p>\r\n<p><b>To bypass geo-restrictions<\/b>: The main reason people download apks from the above sites is to get region-specific apps. The promise of APKPure is that users can download region-specific apps. This way, they won't have to worry about problems like unavailability in your region.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Get the latest update<\/b>: Most people download apks from the above sites to get the latest version of the app without waiting for the Google Play Store to roll out gradually to push the updates. To explain it in detail, the Google Play Store has the option of phased deployments to detect any major issues, stop the update, and provide a new update with fixes. Some features are also present in the latest update, but you want to try them right away. In this case, you can download the APK from sites like APKPure and get the latest functionality. Since these come from the original source, you won't have a problem with subsequent updates, either.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Access to older versions<\/b>: Another reason why people use APKPure, rather than Google Play, is that you can access older versions of apps, including changelog information and descriptions. If you've downloaded the latest version of the software update of a mobile app and it starts to crash, you can go back to an older, more secure update. This will guide you until the new one is fixed. If you want, you can also continue using the previous version. You can also use the file for research purposes to compare changes from one version to another.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/famisafe.wondershare.com\/images\/article\/2020\/11\/apkpure-download-3.jpg\" alt=\"is apkpure safe\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\"><\/p>\r\n<p><b>Freedom<\/b>: A much smaller group of people who just don't want the Play Store installed on their phone believe, rightly or wrongly, this is their decision, that Google invades their privacy and avoids their products where they can.<\/p><div><\/div><\/div>",

Just like&nbsp;Windows (PC) systems use an .exe file for installing software, the APK does the same for Android.<\/p><p>When you download an APK online, you're essentially getting an app. Most users get apps from the Google Play Store, without ever seeing the word APK. But there are occasions when you would want to do otherwise.<\/p><p>In 2021, Google started phasing out APK files on the Play Store, replacing them with the more flexible AAB format. But because AAB files are custom-made to each device, they require different steps to install.<\/p><\/div>",

Also, some apps are restricted to regions outside of your own. App updates can take a frustrating amount of time to arrive automatically&nbsp;over the air. Getting the latest APK for your favorite apps will let you jump the queue.&nbsp;Or you might even not like a particular app after an update, and want to install an older version instead.<\/p><p>And if&nbsp;your Android device lacks access to the Google Play Store, APK files may be your only option for installing&nbsp;apps on your device.<\/p><ul>\r\n<li>Accidentally deleted the Google Play Store?, here's how to get the APK and&nbsp;restore it<\/li>\r\n<\/ul><p>Be careful though, you don't want to download stolen apps. Some APK services let you download pirated apps. This is illegal and should be avoided. Worse still, sketchy APK files may contain malware, as many who thought they were getting early versions of Fortnite for Android discovered to their dismay. Do some research before you download&nbsp;so you don't do anything against the law or contaminate your device.<\/p><\/div>",

Users simply upload their own APK files to the website, and then, in turn, you can download those files onto your device.<\/p><p>In the interim, however,<strong> the skilled staff members of APKPure will take a look at the file and ensure that it meets the website\u2019s guidelines<\/strong>, before they allow users like you to download it. Owing to the high volume of apps under review, it usually takes three or so days for the staff to give their approval to any given APK file.<\/p><p>The service also takes care to match the file on their own website with the file of the same application that\u2019s already available in the database of the Google Play Store. The <strong>cryptographic signatures<\/strong> of both apps are compared, allowing the staff of APKPure to see whether or not the file is the same.<\/p><p>Generally, the file is the same \u2013 with the ultimate result of greater security for end users. This feature is particularly helpful because APKs that were downloaded from other websites are not necessarily secure. They might have had a secure file as a baseline, which was later modified or tampered with to incorporate malware as part of its structure.<\/p><p>This being said, it\u2019s true that no web service is completely safe: problems related to security can always arise. Indeed, this is especially the case when a website, like APKPure, is open to the public, so that users can upload APK files from their own devices.<\/p><p>However, the staff of APKPure are also ready and willing to deal with any issues you may have, including security issues. They even ask, on their website, that \u2013 if you\u2019ve been experiencing problems of any kind when using the service \u2013 that you tell them about the problem.<\/p><p>This ensures that they can best devote their resources to repairing the issue.<\/p><h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12896 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/trendket.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/apkpure4.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"auto\"><\/h3><\/div>",

There is no guarantee that they are 100% safe.

The site allows users to upload their apps. When you open a service like that up to the community \u2013 security risks are always present.<\/p><p>However, the staff and customer-support personnel of APKPure have historically been open and honest with their users. They have worked with them through problems and notified them of potential, developing security risks.<\/p><p>Plus, the market of people using APKPure is much smaller than the incredibly vast market of people using the Play Store.
