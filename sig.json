Switching to it as your main messenger can be a bit daunting, so to help, we created a guide to walk you through the process.<\/p><p>As Signal continues to grow, many of its new features get lost on new users. Not only has Signal added new ways to keep your conversations private, but they've also added iMessage-like features to make it easier for people to make the switch and to enhance communications. However, as with all messaging services, to take full advantage of its features, you need the recipient to also use Signal.<\/p><p>Our hope with this guide is that it helps you figure out how to set up Signal and get the most out of it. Additionally, we hope you share this article with friends and family, so when you ask them to switch, the process isn't as jarring.

    "slide_title_2" : "#2: How to Set Up Your Clubhouse App Profile",
    "slide_content_2" : "<p>Like other social media apps, Clubhouse gives you a profile that will tell others a little more about you and what you have to offer.<\/p>\r\n<p>For your profile photo, you can choose a photo from your camera roll or use your camera to take a new photo. Whichever method you choose, choose a photo that:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Shows your face, preferably smiling and framed well inside the photo.<\/li>\r\n<li>Looks good in several sizes. This photo will be shown throughout the app, sometimes with your name and sometimes by itself. The clearer your photo is, the more recognizable you\u2019ll be.<\/li>\r\n<li>Has a clear background with contrasting colors. The background colors on Clubhouse are white to an off-white and light beige, which are nice and neutral so your photo can stand out. Having a bright background in your photo can really make your profile pop when looking at a sea of profile photos.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Clubhouse gives you plenty of room to write out a complete bio. The first three lines (roughly 125 characters) are available as a preview while in rooms on the app, making those the most important words in your bio.<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/clubhouse-profile-preview-in-room-400@2x.png\" alt=\"ALT\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"338\" height=\"508\"><\/p>\r\n<p>The Clubhouse editor is a plain-text editor, meaning there\u2019s no markup, hyperlinking, or formatting. You can\u2019t easily place emojis into your bio.<\/p>\r\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/clubhouse-app-editor-400@2x.png\" alt=\"ALT\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"338\" height=\"326\"><\/p>\r\n<p>As I already mentioned, the first three lines are the most important words in your Clubhouse bio. The preview screen shows only your photo, how many followers you have, how many people you\u2019re following, and those three lines. There\u2019s no word or character count limit on your profile, but if your bio is too long, when you try to save it you\u2019ll get a message in red that asks you to try to write a shorter bio.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here are some other tips for building out your Clubhouse profile:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Clubhouse is a networking and real-time conversation app so make sure your profile defines the value you bring to the conversation.<\/li>\r\n<li>The only clickable links on your profile are your Twitter and Instagram profile links but you can post other links in the bio. If you do post more links in your bio, make sure they\u2019re easy to remember because others won\u2019t be able to copy and paste those links.<\/li>\r\n<li>List topics you\u2019re interested in discussing to let people know what types of conversations you want to be invited to.<\/li>\r\n<li>Use keywords strategically to help people find you if they use the search function but avoid keyword stuffing.<\/li>\r\n<li>Write and edit your bio in an outside app to break up long paragraphs.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>Many Clubhouse users opt to write and format their bios in an outside app such as notepad, and then copy and paste the completed bio into their profile. While your bio still won\u2019t have any clickable links, you can add some basic formatting, and emojis this way.<\/p>",
