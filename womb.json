Just snap a picture of your face or upload an image from your camera roll, and push a button to have the image lip-sync to one of a handful of meme-adjacent songs. The app\u2019s software will work its magic on anything that even vaguely resembles a face and many things that don\u2019t. Although similar apps in the past have been dogged by privacy fears, Benkhin is adamant users\u2019 data is safe. \u201CWe take privacy really seriously,\u201D he says. \u201CAll the data gets deleted and we don\u2019t share it or send it to anyone else.\u201D<\/p><\/div>",
