At most levels, different gimmicks will appear as you move forward, and you will need to consult with your peers and think about new ways to cooperate.<br><br>This version is essentially a port of the one we released on the Nintendo Switch in 2019.<br>However, it's not just a port, it now supports online play.<br><br>The 2016 version of this link has been renamed  \"PICO PARK:Classic Edition\"<br><br>[Flexible Level]<br>Each level of PICO PARK can be cleared when players get the key,unlock the door and all players reach it.But, every level requires cooperation to complete..<br><br>[Battle Mode]<br>Co-op play is the main work of this game, but let's compete with friends in BATTLE MODE once co-op play is completed.<br><br>[Endless Mode]<br>Even if you complete all 48 stages, you can play ENDLESS mode to aim at high score by collaborating with friends. By collaborating with friends, your score will grow faster.<br><br>[Online Play Mode]<br>You can play together online with people who are far away from you. <br>However, this is a game where communication is very important, so we recommend using Discord or Zoom to play while talking.<\/div>",
