After opening the door while seeing the baby teleporting to the dining table, the sitter then fed the baby while changing his diaper after feeding him as usual. However, when the sitter attempted to change the diaper, the baby used his telekinetic power to levitate the diaper for fun while unlocking the parent's bedroom and placed it there so that the sitter could catch it much to the sitter's dismay. As a result, the sitter attempts to access the parent's bedroom in order to find a spare diaper for the baby. After changing the baby's diaper, the sitter then noticed that the baby teleported near the stairs as the room went dark all of the sudden.

This was further evidenced by the cat drawings scattered across the room that the babysitter had found and touched in both the First Day and the Second Day which resulted in their souls freed from the Baby in Yellow's grasp.\r\n<\/p><\/div>",

However, when the sitter took the elevator to leave the apartment, the elevator mysteriously crashed\u2013heavily implied to be the baby's doing\u2013as the sitter miraculously survived which causes the sitter to be stranded in the 22nd floor and has no choice but to find another elevator that is usable. At the same time when using an elevator, they heard about a murmuring of someone named Pickman that took a pity out of them and taunted them by revealing his possessive behavior towards the object that the sitter seeks. \r\n<\/p><p>However, as the sitter traveled through the corridor of the 22nd floor and found a door that leads to an elevator, the door was mysteriously locked by a moon padlock as it was revealed that the baby did it and took the key to open the door. The baby then decided to play a cat and mouse game in the apartment of the musician, A. Pickman, as the sitter attempts to catch him to get the key to no avail due to the baby constantly using his teleportation skills to evade capture. Investigating the apartment even further, especially seeing the piano located inside the apartment, the sitter decided to play a song that could lure the Baby in Yellow in order to capture him. To do so, they found several scattered song lyrics that could play \"The King's Lullaby\" scattered across the room and play the song for the baby. \r\n<\/p><p>When playing the King's Lullaby on the piano, the baby becomes excited but at the same time gets bounced from the piano's case which causes him to cry despite the song isn't completed yet. Despite this however, the sitter was unable to capture the baby. After playing the song, the piano case revealed a secret compartment that has a switch. As the sitter pressed a switch, it led to a secret room which contained a record of the King's Lullaby song. Knowing that the apartment has a phonograph, the sitter decided to play the record there which caused the baby to be happy as he got distracted with the song. This resulted in the mission of taking the key from the baby easier which causes the baby to cry in the end. \r\n<\/p><\/div>",

As a result, the white rabbit picture decided to lead the sitter to the Electrical Room of the 22nd Floor to fix the power outage. Investigating the power room, the sitter saw several mysterious codes scattered across the room such as number \"43\" with the last two numbers being blank written on the whiteboard and number \"17\" with the first two numbers being blank written on a note of one of the Janitor's lockers. Attempting to fix the power of the elevator, the Baby in Yellow appears at the Electrical Room and steals one of the fuses and pops it. Knowing that the codes that the sitter found would open a hatch in the Electrical Room, the sitter decided to throw the baby there to stop his mischievous attitude which caused him to emit a creepy laugh as the sitter decided to fix the power to operate the elevator in the end. \r\n<\/p><p>However, shortly after getting out of the Electrical Room, the entire corridor of 22nd Floor suddenly turned strange with tentacles being everywhere across the vicinity of the 22nd Floor and the baby seemingly crying, begging the sitter to not leave or else they will regret it while also calling them a coward via the cryptic writings in the wall. After reaching the elevator, the sitter then saw the baby turning into a monstrous form and attempted to catch the sitter. Locking the two doors so that he could catch the sitter easier, the sitter manages to escape from the baby by using the elevator which causes the baby to plead towards the sitter to stay in the apartment forever.\r\n<\/p><p>Seemingly escaping from the Baby in Yellow's grasp, it was then revealed that the baby decided to use his trump card to trap the sitter again in the reversed version of the baby's apartment after getting out from the avoid. If the sitter decides to take care of the baby again, they will be trapped in the endless loop forever. Investigating the apartment and revealed that the door to the bedroom was locked, the sitter decided to find the key to open the locked bedroom. After finding the key, it leads to a long corridor as the baby decides to hinder the sitter's progress by making them put him into bed. If the sitter complies, they will be trapped in the endless loop with the White Rabbit reprimanding the sitter for not complying to the baby's demands. If the sitter decided to refuse to take care of the baby, the latter made a clone of himself, pleading to take him to sleep. Failing to trap the sitter to his grasp, the baby attempts to make the sitter watch several TV scattered across the corridor so that he could trap them easier while mocking them for being a scared little rabbit. \r\n<\/p><p>Ignoring the baby's pleas to watch the TVs scattered across the corridor which causes him to cry, the sitter then decided to go to the next corridor. In the next corridor, the room went dark all of a sudden as the baby became agitated towards the sitter for ignoring his pleas. As the sitter reached the end of the corridor, they discovered the monstrous form of the baby and when encountered, the baby then reverted into his normal form, trying to persuade them to put him to sleep in the dark dimension he had created. If the sitter complies, the baby will turn into his satanic form and jumpscared the sitter, damning their soul in Carcosa forever. However, the sitter could ignore his pleas by throwing him into an endless void which creates a brand new path for the sitter to escape. \r\n<\/p><p>Despite escaping from the baby's grasp, the baby still mocks the sitter for being the vulnerable little coward they were. After seemingly reaching the exit, the baby then turned into his monstrous form again, trying to catch the sitter while taunting them for being a coward. Despite the hardship the sitter went through to the point the baby uses any means to prevent them escaping such as using blocks, toy trains, and milk bottles, the sitter manages to escape the apartment once and for all with the baby suddenly gracefully accepted his defeat, saying that there will always be more victims for him to be trapped in his dimension.\r\n<\/p><\/div>",
