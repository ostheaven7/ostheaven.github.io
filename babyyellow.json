Heavily implied to be the King of Yellow, Hastur, that took form of the baby or possessed it, the Baby in Yellow has a penchant to trap his babysitters on his dimension known as Carcosa after babysitting him and attempts to do the same with the current babysitter that tries to babysit him. The baby also has no hesitations to turn into a monstrous form solely to capture his babysitter so that they could stay in Carcosa forever.<\/div>",

As the game started, the sitter performed some daily routines to take care of the baby, feeding him, changing his diapers and taking him to bed. Although the sitter experience a bit of supernatural occurences such as the baby teleporting near the stairs when the sitter attempting to change his diaper. After putting the baby to bed and wanting to watch the TV so that they could take a break and waiting for the parents to come home, the sitter then heard the cries of the baby as they went to the room to check what's going on. It was then revealed that the baby was not in his bedroom as the sitter attempted to find him who was then crying in the living room. After finding the baby, the sitter then brought him to bed again and put him to sleep as they decided to watch TV after finishing the task while waiting for the baby's parents to come home as they began to fall asleep on the sofa.<\/div>",

However, he was then reprimanded by the babysitter to not do it again. After watching the TV together with the baby, the sitter then continued their usual routine by starting to feed him, only to find out the lights were out and the door at the kitchen was locked automatically. After opening the door while seeing the baby teleporting to the dining table, the sitter then fed the baby while changing his diaper after feeding him as usual. However, when the sitter attempted to change the diaper, the baby used his telekinetic power to levitate the diaper for fun while unlocking the parent's bedroom and placed it there so that the sitter could catch it much to the sitter's dismay. As a result, the sitter attempts to access the parent's bedroom in order to find a spare diaper for the baby. After changing the baby's diaper, the sitter then noticed that the baby teleported near the stairs as the room went dark all of the sudden. After things went back to normal, the sitter then brought the baby to bed as they tried to watch TV and wait for the parents as usual.\r\n<\/p><p>On the same day, however, before doing their usual routine, the sitter also found a mysterious key at the dining table and if the players decided to use the key, it would lead to a storage room located between the parents room and the baby's room. The storage room contained a tape of the previous babysitter recounting his experience with babysitting the Baby in Yellow as it was revealed that his soul was trapped in the apartment forever alongside the previous babysitters after babysitting the Baby in Yellow. This was further evidenced by the cat drawings scattered across the room that the babysitter had found and touched in both the First Day and the Second Day which resulted in their souls freed from the Baby in Yellow's grasp.\r\n<\/p><\/div>",

After calming the baby down by putting him to sleep, the sitter decided to have some food downstairs to furnish their appetite. However, after they went downstairs, they saw the apartment turning weird as it went dark and also leaving several cryptic messages across the room that said&nbsp;\"Feed Me\".
