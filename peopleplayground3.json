It was released on Steam for Microsoft Windows on July 23, 2019. The game features a wide variety of items, including firearms, melee weapons, explosives, vehicles and more, along with several widely open maps to play in. There is no end goal to this game, since it is a sandbox, with the main purpose of the game being spawning and killing ragdolls in a wide variety of ways, hence the official description \"shoot, stab, burn, poison, tear, vaporize, or crush ragdolls in a large open space\". This game also allows modding, where players could create custom modifications for this game to share for the public.\r\n  <br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/image.winudf.com\/v2\/image1\/Y29tLnBlb3BsZV9wbGF5Z3JvdW5kLm1wZW9wbGVwbGF5Z3JvdW5kc2ltdWxhdGlvbnRpcHNfc2NyZWVuXzJfMTYwOTM1NzE4MF8wMDc\/screen-2.jpg?fakeurl=1&amp;type=.jpg\" width=\"350\"><\/div>",

This \u201CN\u201D stands for \u201CNormal\u201D, which is the standard layer style, but you can also use a huge range of styles that will have a different impact on your artwork.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.thewonderforest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/procreate-screenshot-6.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, \u201Cmultiply\u201D will make the layer darker and slightly transparent, while \u201Cscreen\u201D will make it lighter. There are lots of settings here so take some time to experiment and research what each one does and how you might be able to use it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you make a new layer, you can tap it to open the layer settings. This is where you can name, duplicate or clear your layer, or merge it with a layer below. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Within this menu, you\u2019ll see the options \u201CMask\u201D and \u201CClipping mask\u201D, which can be helpful for drawing.

Procreate comes with a number of fantastic brushes already downloaded, but you can also buy brushes from other artists on places like Gumroad and Etsy. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These brushes can replicate everything from a fun and funky pattern, to impressively realistic watercolour paint. Take some time to look at what\u2019s available and see how you might use the brushes in your artwork. Over time, you will probably find favourite brushes that you come back to time and time again.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also use brushes to smudge or erase your artwork. When you have smudge selected (the icon to the right of your brush), you can use your brush shape, texture, size and opacity to blend the colours of your drawing. Lots of artists use this for shading. Your eraser works in the same way, using your brush to erase layers.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can edit brushes even further by clicking on the brush in your brush library. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.thewonderforest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/procreate-screenshot-8.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here you can edit absolutely every aspect of the brush, from simple concepts like the spacing and size, to the way colours wet mix together. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is also where you can play around with a setting called \u201CStreamline\u201D, which will subtly neaten the curves of your lines so they are less jittery and uneven. This may be a helpful setting while you are still getting used to drawing with Procreate, or if you are creating detailed linework.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you start to understand the brush settings, you can even use them to create your own brushes that are perfectly catered to what you want!<\/span><\/p><\/div>",
