You play as Nicholas Roth, a young boy who is trying to find out the secrets of his neighbor. Nicky goes through suspicion, abduction, trauma, and acception during this game, all because of Mr. Peterson.\r\n  <br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/static.wikia.nocookie.net\/hello-neighbor\/images\/4\/42\/World2.png\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/500?cb=20211211010530\" width=\"350\"><\/div>",

Using the books, we got the full story for most of the game. Theodore locks up his son, Aaron, after he accidentally killed Mya so that Aaron wouldn't die too.\r\n<p><\/p><p>Nicky breaks in to save Aaron after seeing Theodore lock him up. After he breaks into the basement, Theodore finds him and catches him. Two months later, Nicky escapes with the help of Aaron, but gets PTSD caused by the traumatic experience.\r\n<\/p><p>19 years later, Nicky gets evicted due to non-payment but moves back to his home in Raven Brooks. He notices that Theodore's house is destroyed, so he walks over to it and starts remembering everything that happened there. He gets paranoid and starts seeing things.

While playing, the player will hear a child scream from across the street in Mr. Peterson's House. Nicky, the protagonist, will then investigate the house. Once witnessing Mr. Peterson appears in some kind of distress, he will spot Nicky and charge at them. After appearing in Nicky Roth's House, the player will be able to explore the house and begin with the game. Without getting caught, the player must run to a closed-off room that can be opened with a near-by lever. In that same room, the player must turn on the electricity to that floor and place a bowling ball in front of a fan. Before turning on the fan, the player should grab any object like a box. Once the fan is turned on, the player must run back outside without getting caught by the Neighbor and to a platform that runs up and down the right side of the house before it shoots up without the player. If the player is not able to get on the platform before it goes up, they must redo all the steps until they are able to get through the window to the second floor. Once the player has gotten to the second floor through the window, the player can get the red key to the basement. after getting through the door, the player will discover a seemingly simple basement, but when examining the washer\/drier, the player will find out that it is an entryway to another site that lies beneath the house. A small section of the area underneath looks like a room of sorts with only a bed, a few candles, a basketball, and cans of food. Using the basketball on one of the windows, the player can go through the open space and explore the available area, and attempt to solve a puzzle that unlocks the door. At a very last door, the player will go through and go through the final chase sequence of the first act. The door at the end will be locked, causing the player to be caught by Theodore. <br>\r\n  <img src=\"https:\/\/static.wikia.nocookie.net\/hello-neighbor\/images\/1\/1f\/Act12rss.JPG\/revision\/latest\/scale-to-width-down\/300?cb=20200724154712\" width=\"350\">\r\n<\/p><\/div>",

Nicky visualizes house extensions, prison walls, and stuff trying to keep him in so that he can face Mr. Peterson.

He hasn't paid rent either, so we can assume Nicky is very low on money. Once Nicky gets evicted due to non-payment and realizes he must leave the apartment within a week, he packs his things and gets out, knowing there's still one place he can live, even if he doesn't want to go back. His old house.\r\n<\/p><p>Once Nicky parks his car in the yard of his old house, he tries to shrug off weird feelings he has, but can't escape the trauma. The memories of his time here are coming back to haunt him, and he can't live his life normally if he doesn't do something about it. He tries giving himself therapy by taking a nap and ending up in a lucid non-dream, where he's in control of a world developed by his fears. The giant house he faces is a representation what he needs to overcome so that he can leave all this behind forever.
